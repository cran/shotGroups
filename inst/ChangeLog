SHOTGROUPS RELEASE VERSIONS at http://cran.r-project.org/

Version 0.2-2 (December 05, 2013)

    * getMinCircle(): fix bug where minimal circle is not identified
                      correctly if it only touches the convex hull in
                      two points (thanks to Karl Schilling for the report)
    * remove modeltools, KernSmooth from Depends field
      (boot is not moved to Imports because energy depends on boot)
	* getDevice(): since RStudio keeps past diagrams, open diagrams in
	  the same device instead of opening new windows
	* compareGroups(): more sensible colors

Version 0.2-1 (May 07, 2012)

    * make opening several new plot windows work under RStudio which
      currently (0.95.265) cannot deal with multiple calls to dev.new()
    * getXYmat(): new utility function to extract the matrix of (x,y)-
                  coordinates relative to point of aim from a data frame
    * getMinBBox(): fix bug where orientation angle would sometimes be
                    that of the shorter (not longer) edge,
                    slightly faster implementation

Version 0.2 (March 13, 2012)

    * compareGroups(): better naming of columns in returned matrices to
                       identify original group
    * compareGroups(): return correlation matrices of (x,y)-coordinates
                       (instead of covariance matrices)
    * groupShape(): return correlation matrix of (x,y)-coordinates
    * groupShape(): better y-axis limits for histograms
    * groupShape(): chi^2 Q-Q-plot of (robust Mahalanobis distances)^2:
                    reference line now has intercept 0 and slope 1, sample
                    quantiles are on the y-axis
    * groupSpread(): don't return correlation matrix of (x,y)-coordinates
                     (only covariance matrix)
    * groupSpread(): option to select the confidence level for the
                     confidence ellipse
    * groupSpread(): return size, aspect ratio and flattening of the
                     confidence ellipse
    * groupSpread(): return modified RAND R-234 estimate for the circular
                     error probable (CEP)
    * groupSpread(): return parametric 95%-confidence intervals for the
                     standard deviations of x- and y-coordinates
    * getConfEll(): new function to return measures of a confidence ellipse
    * getCEP(): new function to return estimates for the circular error
                probable (CEP)
    * DFsavage: new dataset with groups from a rifle at 100 to 300m,
                thanks to Charles & Paul McMillan
    * DFtalon: new dataset with groups from an air gun at 10m,
               thanks to Charles & Paul McMillan
    * getMinBBox(): more efficient implementation (rotating calipers)
    * getMinCircle(): fix bug for cases where minimum enclosing circle
                      is defined by two points
    * drawEllipse(): fix bug for ellipse sometimes being slightly misoriented
    * compareGroups(): fix bug for plotting data from more than 8 groups
    * make functions work when there are only 2 points
    * leave out robust estimations with less than 4 points

Version 0.1 (March 07, 2012)

    * initial release
