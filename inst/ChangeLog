SHOTGROUPS RELEASE VERSIONS at http://cran.r-project.org/

Version 0.2 (March 13, 2012)

    * compareGroups(): better naming of columns in returned matrices to identify original group
    * compareGroups(): return correlation matrices of (x,y)-coordinates (instead of covariance matrices)
    * groupShape(): return correlation matrix of (x,y)-coordinates
    * groupShape(): better y-axis limits for histograms
    * groupShape(): chi^2 Q-Q-plot of (robust Mahalanobis distances)^2: reference line now has intercept 0 and slope 1, sample quantiles are on the y-axis
    * groupSpread(): don't return correlation matrix of (x,y)-coordinates (only covariance matrix)
    * groupSpread(): option to select the confidence level for the confidence ellipse
    * groupSpread(): return size, aspect ratio and flattening of the confidence ellipse
    * groupSpread(): return modified RAND R-234 estimate for the circular error probable (CEP)
    * groupSpread(): return parametric 95%-confidence intervals for the standard deviations of x- and y-coordinates
    * getConfEll(): new function to return measures of a confidence ellipse
    * getCEP(): new function to return estimates for the circular error probable (CEP)
    * DFsavage: new dataset with groups from a rifle at 100 to 300m, thanks to Charles & Paul McMillan
    * DFtalon: new dataset with groups from an air gun at 10m, thanks to Charles & Paul McMillan
    * getMinBBox(): more efficient implementation (rotating calipers)
    * getMinCircle(): fix bug for cases where minimum enclosing circle is defined by two points
    * drawEllipse(): fix bug where ellipse was sometimes slightly misoriented
    * compareGroups(): fix bug where only data from first 8 groups was plotted
    * make functions work when there are only 2 points
    * leave out robust estimations with less than 4 points
