SHOTGROUPS RELEASE VERSIONS at http://cran.r-project.org/

Version 0.3 (January 08, 2013)

    * Note that this release breaks backwards compatibility by renaming a
      few returned list components, changing default values, adding and
      and removing a few options, and chaning return values (see below)
    * Add package vignette: see vignette("shotGroups")
    * DF300blk, DFcciHV, DFscar17: new datasets with groups from shooting
      different rifles at 100 yd
      (thanks: David Bookstaber http://ballistipedia.com/)
    * analyzeGroup(): if no point of aim is given: warn and assume (0,0);
      if no distance to target is given: warn and assume 100; add option to
      select which CEP estimate to report; coordinates of points of impact
      can be named either X, Y or Point.X, Point.Y
    * combineData(): if no point of aim is given: warn and assume (0,0);
      if no distance to target is given: warn and assume 100; if no Group
      is given: warn and assume 1; coordinates of points of impact can be
      named either X, Y or Point.X, Point.Y
    * compareGroups(): if no point of aim is given: warn and assume (0,0);
      if no distance to target is given: warn and assume 100; report
      parametric confidence intervals for standard deviations of x and y;
      coordinates of points of impact can be named either X, Y or Point.X,
      Point.Y; report figure of merit and length of the diagonal of the
      minimum-area bounding box instead of its width and height; report
      Rayleigh 50% CEP estimate instead of modified RAND-234 estimate; fix
      bug where distance to center would be incorrectly calculated for data
      with scrambled Group variable
    * drawBox(), drawBox2(), drawCircle(), drawEllipse(): make generic
      with methods to also accept objects returned by getBoundingBox(),
      getMinBBox(), getMinCircle(), getConfEll(), respectively
    * getBoundingBox(): report figure of merit (average side length of the
      box) and length of the diagonal
    * getCEP(): better calculation of Rayleigh and RAND estimator; add
      Grubbs-Patnaik estimator; add option to take into account
      systematic location (accuracy) bias - by default, bias is ignored
      as before; add option to select which estimate to report; also return
      group center
    * getConfEll(): also return (robust) group center and (robust)
      covariance matrix with its trace and determinant
    * getMinBBox(): report figure of merit (average side length of the box)
      and length of the diagonal
    * getMOA(): units for distance to target and for coordinates can be a
      mixture of imperial (yd, ft, in) and metric units (m, cm, mm)
    * getRayParam(): new function to estimate radial precision parameter
      sigma of the Rayleigh distribution together with the Rayleigh
      standard deviation RSD and mean MR including confidence intervals
    * groupLocation(): for bootstrap-CIs of center, sample (x,y)-coords
      simultaneously instead of bootstrapping x, y separately; report
      parametric CIs and bootstrap CIs for center x, y in the same list
      components, respectively, with new names ctrXci, ctrYci; remove
      option unit as it can be inferred from option conversion; option
      caliber now needs to be given in mm; add option to select CI level;
      values for option target are now called "BDS25m" and "DSB25m"
      bugfix for plotting a target with imperial measurement units
    * groupShape(): add option to select which outlier identification
      method to use - outlier='mcd' is as before, 'pca' uses the robust
      principal components analysis from mvoutlier::pcout()
    * groupSpread(): report parametric and bootstrap confidence intervals
      for (x,y) standard deviations in separate list components, and add
      MOA; report empirical median as well as mean distance to center, add
      option to report either Rayleigh or Gauss estimates for precision
      parameter sigma, radial standard deviation RSD, and mean radius MR;
      report parametric and bootstrap confidence intervals for sigma, RSD,
      MR; report width, height, figure of merit and diagonal for bounding
      box as well as for minimum bounding box; add option to select which
      CEP estimate to report; add Rayleigh fit to histogram of distances
      to group center
    * groupLocation(), groupShape(), groupSpread(), getBoundingBox(),
      getCEP, getConfEll()(), getDistToCtr(), getMaxPairDist(),
      getMinBBox(), getMinCircle(): make generic with methods to also
      accept a data frame either with variables Point.X, Point.Y or X, Y
    * fromMOA(): bugfix increasing numerical precision for large sizes
    * readData*(): default is now combine=TRUE
    * readDataMisc(): coordinates of points of impact can be named either
      X, Y or Point.X, Point.Y
    * DFlistInch, DFlistSavage, DFlistTalon: remove lists of data frames as
      they serve no purpose beyond DFlistCm
    * Documentation improvements

Version 0.2-2 (December 05, 2013)

    * getMinCircle(): fix bug where minimal circle is not identified
      correctly if it only touches the convex hull in two points
      (thanks: Karl Schilling)
    * remove modeltools, KernSmooth from Depends field
      (boot is not moved to Imports because energy depends on boot)
    * getDevice(): since RStudio keeps past diagrams, open diagrams in
      the same device instead of opening new windows
    * compareGroups(): more sensible colors

Version 0.2-1 (May 07, 2012)

    * make opening several new plot windows work under RStudio which
      currently (0.95.265) cannot deal with multiple calls to dev.new()
    * getXYmat(): new utility function to extract the matrix of (x,y)-
      coordinates relative to point of aim from a data frame
    * getMinBBox(): fix bug where orientation angle would sometimes be
      that of the shorter (not longer) edge, slightly faster implementation

Version 0.2 (March 13, 2012)

    * compareGroups(): better naming of columns in returned matrices to
      identify original group
    * compareGroups(): return correlation matrices of (x,y)-coordinates
      (instead of covariance matrices)
    * groupShape(): return correlation matrix of (x,y)-coordinates
    * groupShape(): better y-axis limits for histograms
    * groupShape(): chi^2 Q-Q-plot of (robust Mahalanobis distances)^2:
      reference line now has intercept 0 and slope 1, sample quantiles are on
      the y-axis
    * groupSpread(): don't return correlation matrix of (x,y)-coordinates
      (only covariance matrix)
    * groupSpread(): option to select the confidence level for the confidence
      ellipse
    * groupSpread(): return size, aspect ratio and flattening of the
      confidence ellipse
    * groupSpread(): return modified RAND R-234 estimate for the circular
      error probable (CEP)
    * groupSpread(): return parametric 95%-confidence intervals for the
      standard deviations of x- and y-coordinates
    * getConfEll(): new function to return measures of a confidence ellipse
    * getCEP(): new function to return estimates for the circular error
      probable (CEP)
    * DFsavage: new dataset with groups from a rifle at 100 to 300m
      (thanks: Charles & Paul McMillan http://www.statshooting.com/)
    * DFtalon: new dataset with groups from an air gun at 10m
      (thanks: Charles & Paul McMillan http://www.statshooting.com/)
    * getMinBBox(): more efficient implementation (rotating calipers)
    * getMinCircle(): fix bug for cases where minimum enclosing circle is
      defined by two points
    * drawEllipse(): fix bug for ellipse sometimes being slightly misoriented
    * compareGroups(): fix bug for plotting data from more than 8 groups
    * make functions work when there are only 2 points
    * leave out robust estimations with less than 4 points
